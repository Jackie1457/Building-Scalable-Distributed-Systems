# Building-Scalable-Distributed-Systems

## Overview

This course will cover the essential elements of distributed, concurrent systems and build upon that knowledge with engineering principles and practical experience with state-of-the-art technologies and methods for building scalable systems. Scalability is an essential quality of Internet-facing systems, and requires specialized skills and knowledge to build systems that scale at low cost. 


## Book

The book for the course, Foundations of Scalable Systems, is available for purchase at your favorite retailers, eg [here](https://www.amazon.com/Foundations-Scalable-Systems-Distributed-Architectures/dp/1098106067/ref=asc_df_1098106067/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=564700895175&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=11230893476443846738&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9033322&hvtargid=pla-1643586021023&psc=1). The course materials closely follow the book structure and content.

You can also access this and all O'Reilly books online through the Snell library.
